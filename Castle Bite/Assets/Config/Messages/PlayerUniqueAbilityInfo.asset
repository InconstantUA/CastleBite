  message: "Allows to gain certain bonuses: defense, damage, healing power or add
    poison or life drain to attacks. Some abilities are available only for some Factions.\r\nAbility
    power is increased automatically while unit is using special skills which trigger
    such ability. For example if user uses Defense Stance in battle, then he gains
    a learning point for Tough unique ability, if this ability was chosen.\r\nIt is
    increased only if skill which triggers ability is being used. If unit doesn't
    have such skill by default, then find the way to use ability using potions or
    other items. In case of damage dealing or healing powers after ability has gained
    at least 1 power, it will be automatically used on next attacks and trained without
    need to reuse consumable. Skill power starts with 0 power and applies to every
    unit which is owned by the Player."
